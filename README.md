A mock retail website for flower bouqets, using React. 

## Description

* Nav with links

* Add to basket from the saved page
* Toggle favourite on both the main and saved page to add/remove from favourites
* Go to basket via basket icon on bouqet item or using the nav
* Basket total and mock checkout using setTimeout which resets the basket
